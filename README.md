# Hw09 - make and building a pipeline
## Rowenna Gryba

make-activity
=============

This homework is based off the code provided as part of the Stat547 in class [activity](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/automation04_make-activity.html) from the STAT 545/547 [githup](http://stat545-ubc.github.io). 

To expand on the activity in class I have added R script to develop... and an Rmarkdown file to provide reporting on...

The files and output can be found here:
